 Create a constant called `myAge` and set it to your age. Then, create a constant called `isTeenager` that uses Boolean logic to determine if the age denotes someone in the age range of 13 to 19.

 Create another constant called `leonardosAge` and set it to 14, the age of Leonardo in the 1984 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic. Then, create a constant called `eitherAreTeenagers` that uses Boolean logic to determine if either you or Leonardo are teenagers.

 ### IF STATEMENTS AND BOOLEANS
 You've already created a constant called "myAge" and checked to see if you are a teenager. Using that information, write an if statement to print out "Teenager" if you're a teenager, and "Not a teenager" if you're not.
